For "TASK 4" in my summer internship, I built a Weather-App that fetches weather data from a weather API based on the user's location or a user-inputted location. It displays the current weather conditions, temperature, including other relevant information.

This task was probably by far the most intense one and I certainly got to learn a lot. 

For the weather API data I used: https://lnkd.in/d2D4ByzC

Source Code Editor: VS Code 

HTML, CSS, JavaScript incorporated. 
 
I have included a screenshot of the project as well.
